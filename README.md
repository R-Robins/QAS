# QAS
Queueing Network Animation and Simulation System

A program for use in the instruction of queueing theory. 
The program contains five queueing systems with user-definable parameters. 

Each system has numerical results calculated using event-driven simulation, which are displayed to the user.  

Jobs may be seen through the use of a visualization component. The speed of the visualizer may be increased,decreased, or paused and a single step mode exists to process one visual event at a time. The visualization can be forgone completely through a maximum speed mode to generate quick results. 

QAS is written as a web application to be utilized online through a browser.

Can be run through the index.html file.
The program is assumed to be run on a home computer instead of a mobile device and scaling is not supported.
