Queueing Network Animation and Simulation System  
Documentation : https://github.com/R-Robins/QAS/blob/main/Richard%20John%20Robinson_917046226_Queueing%20Model%20Animation%20and%20Simulation%20System.pdf

A program for use in the instruction of queueing theory. 
The program contains five queueing systems with user-definable parameters. Discrete event simulators were created for each system, which feed results into a visual representation of the system. 


Can be run through the index.html file.
The program is assumed to be run on a home computer instead of a mobile device and scaling is not supported. I wanted to make the program without external libraries and give myself a chance to better my core understanding of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML development. I have learned a lot through this project and it is indeed usable and will generate correct results, but if I were to remake it I would change quite a bit how the user interface was done.
